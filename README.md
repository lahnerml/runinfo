Simple script that linearly interpolates how long it will take to run a
with a given average pace.
Additionally, it gives the average pace that is needed to finish in a given
time.

To determine the average pace needed to finish within a specified time call the
script as
runinfo dist $distance dur $duration

To determine the time it will take to race a distance with a given average pace
call the script as
runinfo dist $distance avg $average
